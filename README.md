# (Dataset Exploration Title)

## Dataset

The information was made up of 113,937 or so borrower characteristics of loans. The qualities included job information like the borrower's current position and length of work, as well as other information like credit score, salary range, etc. The analysis excluded sixty-six data points since they were not going to be included in it.
I wanted to look at the borrower traits that could impact their interest rate in my inquiry. The borrower's work position, salary range, credit rating, and whether or not they are homeowners were given the most attention.

## Summary of Findings

I wanted to look at the borrower traits that could impact their interest rate in my inquiry. The borrower's work position, salary range, credit rating, and whether or not they are homeowners were given the most attention.
## Key Insights for Presentation
For the presentation, I focus on just the characteristics of borrowers
and leave out most of the intermediate derivations. I start by introducing the
BorrowerAPR variable, followed by other variables of interesr, then plot the
corellation heatmap and scatterplot quantitative variables.

Afterwards, I visualized the relationship of each of the categorical variables  one by one with the variable of interest Borrower APR, I used the violin plots,box and bar plot to do this.

Interest rates vary depending on risk (the borrower's ability to repay the loan); loans with higher levels of risk have higher interest rates than loans with lower levels of risk.
